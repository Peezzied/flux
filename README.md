# Flux

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) developed by Karol John. 
The developer published the project's source code to help aspiring students in their web development journey. It's worth noting that a self-taught web developer student developed this project, whereas the project lacked optimization (such as code splitting or poor routing) and could benefit from further performance enhancements.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
